A MIPS assembly program that solves a Sudoku board. The input is a board with empty cells and the output is the solution for the board. 
The project will implemet two variants: a 4x4 and 9x9 Sudoku solver. For both Sudoku variants, input will consist of lines of 
integers corresponding to a row in the Sudoku board. Cells that are empty will be represented by 0. For the 4x4 solver, there will always be
four input lines consisting of four integers for each line. For example, a valid input will look like the following:
2100
0320
0004
1000
The solution for this board must look like the following:
2143
4321
3214
1432
The, for the 9x9 solver, there will always be nine input lines consisting of nine integers for each line.
